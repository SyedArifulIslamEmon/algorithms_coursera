'''

BFS searches via breadth first, using a queue as an auxillary data structure.
This is in comparison to DFS, which lends itself to recursion.

BFS happens to give us the shortest path, as by using a queue, we are
processing items in first-in-first out order. The first time we get to the vertex
is always the shortest path to the vertex.
