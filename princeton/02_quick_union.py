'''

- Construct uses a list, with indexes again representing the nodes, and the corresponding elements keeping track of whether a node is part of a component
- This time, the elements represent a pointer to the parent
- Faster unions using this construct, as we only really have to change the element of the new node
- Here, unions will always add on the parent
