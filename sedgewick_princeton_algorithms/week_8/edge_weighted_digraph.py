'''

In edge-weighted digraphs, the edges are directed, with weighted edges.
Shortest-path applications are the most relevant; map directions, texture-mapping,
urban traffic planning, network routing protocols.

Relevant vocabulary:
  - Source-sink: From one vertex to another
  - Single source: From one vertex to every other
  - All pairs: Between all pairs of vertices

Restrictions on edge weights to consider:
  - Non-negative weights
  - Arbitrary weights
  - Euclidean weights

Cycle considerations:
  - No directed Cycles
  - No "negative cycles"

Simplfying assumptions:
  We'll assume shortest paths froms to each vertex v will exist.
  We won't worry abotu the concept of "driving to an island"
  Single source shortest paths.
  Compute all paths shortest paths.

class EdgeWeightedDigraph:

  '''

  An edge weighted graph maintains a node-indexed dictionary
  of adjacency lists of corresponding edges (each stored as a ref to the object).
  Since this is a directed graph, an edge will be filed under its starting node.

  In previous graphs, I created a separate object for my nodes / vertices.
  To simplify for this one, I'll store the value of my node
  directly as an index, and use a set to store all of the edges.

  '''

  Directed edges are a bit simplier than non-directed edges
  since you only need to store start and end nodes.
