'''

In a digraph, aka directed graph, an edge has a direction.
Vertices in digraphs have in-degrees and out-degrees.
Outdegrees -> number of arrows coming out out the digraph.
Indegree is vice versa.

Examples of digraphs -> an electrical circuit

For digraphs, DFS and BFS are exactly the same as in undirected graphs. BFS still
computes shortest graph in linear time.

Examples: Website crawler is a directed graph using BFS.
(We don't use DFS to crawl - imagine a website like amazon.com...
it will have many links to itself. We should thus take way too long
to get to another domain. More practically speaking, we could accidentally
DDOS a website doing this.)
